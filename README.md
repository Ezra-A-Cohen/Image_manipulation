# Image_manipulation
Project made for the second cohort of code bozu, did image manipulation

This project was worked on collaboratively by Ezra Cohen, Suma Dendi, Hawa Iman, and Eden Hen using Google collab in python

additional note: there are many times where entire functions were written when much less code would have worked, in these cases there were limitations that we were given and the assignment was to work around it
